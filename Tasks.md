# Jade Project Tasks

This document outlines the high-level tasks required to deliver the "Jade" desktop application as described in the PRD. The tasks are grouped by phase and should be revisited as the project evolves.

## 1. Planning & Research
- [ ] Review the PRD in detail and clarify open questions with stakeholders.
- [ ] Research technologies for screen overlays and shader effects on Windows, macOS, and Linux (DirectX, OpenGL, Metal).
- [ ] Evaluate existing tools (e.g., ShaderGlass) for reference and inspiration.
- [ ] Define minimal performance benchmarks and measurement strategy (<5% CPU/GPU overhead).

## 2. Architecture & Design
- [ ] Design the overall application architecture, including the rendering engine and cross-platform abstraction.
- [ ] Outline the user interface flow (launch, filter selection, overlay management).
- [ ] Create wireframes or mockups based on the PRD user flow.
- [ ] Plan how filters will be stored, loaded, and switched.

## 3. Development
- [ ] Set up the project repository with build scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] Implement the basic overlay window capable of capturing and rendering the screen.
- [ ] Implement a shader pipeline to apply visual effects (CRT, Gameboy, Film Grain).
- [ ] Add UI controls for selecting filters and adjusting intensity.
- [ ] Ensure performance monitoring is in place during development.

## 4. Testing & QA
- [ ] Develop unit and integration tests for core functionality.
- [ ] Test the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [ ] Validate performance requirements on typical hardware.

## 5. Release Preparation
- [ ] Package installers for each platform.
- [ ] Write user documentation and update the README.
- [ ] Set up download tracking to measure adoption (downloads, user ratings, etc.).

## 6. Post-Launch
- [ ] Monitor KPIs (downloads, session duration, user ratings).
- [ ] Collect user feedback for future iterations (custom filters, filter marketplace, hotkeys).
